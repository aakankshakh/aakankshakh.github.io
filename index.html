            Hi there! I'm currently an undergraduate student at Mount Allison
            University completing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and
            Mathematics with a minor in Biochemistry. I'm overall interested in
            the ethical implications of using artificial intelligence and machine learning
            in the healthcare domain. If you'd like to
            know more, check out some of the <a href="#work">work</a> I've done!

          <h3>Fun Facts!</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              I've lived in Toronto, (some parts of) India, (many parts of) Nova
              Scotia, and New Brunswick! <em>(in chronological order)</em>
            </li>
            <li>
              I started performing improv shows at the campus pub last year
            </li>
            <li>
              I taught myself to play the guitar when I was around 10 years old,
              and accidentally snapped my high E string trying to tune it to the
              low E
            </li>
            <li>
              In my free time, I love to watch sitcoms, dramedies, and all sorts
              of funky things. Check out this list of

          <p>
            Currently, I'm working on my honours thesis in Computer Science,
            where I am developing a model to detect cybersecurity attacks in a Healthcare Internet of
            Things (IoT). In particular, we are using machine learning techniques and automaton-based modelling.
            The model will have two responsibilities: authenticate new, unknown devices onto the network and monitor the
            IoT network to detect attacks.
          </p>
          <p>
            I was also a summer research intern at
            <a href="https://flux.cs.queensu.ca/mcl/">The Simpson Lab</a>
            developing a Responsible AI podcast (coming out soon!), researching
            capabilities of LLMs in healthcare, and looking at non-western
            ethical frameworks for healthcare AI systems. I also presented my work on
            analyzing racial and gender bias in MIMIC-IV clinical notes at the
            <a href="http://www.smcs.upei.ca/sa2023/">Science Atlantic MSCS
            Conference</a> and won first place for undergraduate computer science talks!
          </p>
          <p>
            Previously, I've worked for Dr. Matthew Betti on mathematical
            epidemiology where I mathematically modelled and analyzed COVID-19
            data in Canada using a modified SIR model and worked on modifying a
            mathematical ODE model of honeybee colonies to analyze the threshold
            for hygienic behaviour.
          </p>
          <p>
            I've also had the opportunity to be a fellow at
            <a href="https://www.ai4goodlab.com">the AI4Good lab</a> in 2022 and
            attend the
            <a href="https://www.bumblekite.co/summer-school-23"
              >Bumblekite machine learning summer school in healthcare and the
              biosciences</a
            >
            in July 2023.

            I am always excited to talk about tech, AI, ethics, and its
            implications for our healthcare system as well as sitcoms, favourite
            books, and the like. <br />
